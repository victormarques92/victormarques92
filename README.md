# Hi, I'm Victor Marques üëã
I am a senior front-end developer and I develop modern and scalable applications using some of the main frameworks and libraries on the market, such as React, Next.js and React Native, as well as fundamental technologies such as TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I have worked in agile environments with methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, integrating multidisciplinary teams to build rich, responsive interfaces focused on user experience. Throughout my career, I have worked on several projects with integrations via REST and GraphQL APIs, always seeking to optimize the performance and quality of applications.

With experience in both consulting and product companies, I am an advocate of best practices such as automated testing, versioning with Git and scalable architecture. I value collaboration, am always open to feedback and believe that innovation and proactivity are essential to deliver impactful solutions in agile environments.
